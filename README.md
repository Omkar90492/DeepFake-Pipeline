# DeepFake-Pipeline
DeepFake Audio Pipeline is a voice cloning system using RVC and Tortoise TTS. It enables training on custom voices, generating synthetic speech, and building large audio datasets. Designed for detection, translation, and media applications using Google Colab.
# DeepFake Audio Pipeline

A deepfake voice synthesis and detection pipeline featuring RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) and Tortoise TTS. The project focuses on creating datasets, training custom voice models, and performing inference.

## üîß Features
- Retrieval-based voice cloning (RVC)
- Tortoise TTS for speech synthesis
- Google Colab notebooks for training/inference
- Bulk dataset creation and preprocessing
- Voice deepfake detection support

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab Notebooks
- RVC, Tortoise TTS
- Jupyter/IPython (Notebook-based)

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Open the training notebook on Google Colab
2. Upload target audio files
3. Train the voice model using RVC + Tortoise TTS
4. Use inference notebook for audio generation
